iterating
=========
a.k.a learning faster and smarter each time

#Philosophy
- google is your friend
  - look up things that confuse you, even if that means looking up practically
    everything
  - this may be frustrating at first, but eventually you'll know enough to
    navigate your way around new concepts without having to look up too much
  - watch out!: don't get caught in the infinite loop of looking up things
    that you don't understand because they're interesting. the stack will always
    go deeper, but you must focus on the task at hand
- break things as much as you can
  - when things break, it's _good_
  - when things break, it's good for them to break _loudly_

#Debugging
- print statements are your friend
- debugging tools and repls are your friend
- stacktraces are your friend
- google is your friend
  - google "how to debug" and read three of the results

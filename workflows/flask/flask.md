- the paragraphs at the top of the page

###START WITH
the Flask mega tutorial by Miguel Grinberg linked under the Flask resources section
- this is going to be a lot and is the main focus of the first part
of this workflow. the goal is to build a toy webapp from the ground up (installation,
flask basics, useful tools etc) as per Grinberg's step-by-step instructions. you'll want
to do this once before you dive in, so you have a good understanding of _how_ the flask
microframework works and _why_ it works that way. then building your own app will be
twice as fast!
- work your way up to step #16


###NEXT

build your own damn app

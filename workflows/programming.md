Programming
===========
- just do the first two seconds for a jumpstart

##bash: the bourne-again shell
- figure out what these commands do, how to use them, and make a cheatsheet:
  pwd, ls, cd, top, less, echo
  - you can get the manual for commands by calling `man` on it, e.g. `man less`
- what are environment variables? what is your `$PATH`? try `echo $PATH`

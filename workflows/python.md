Python
======

- [instant hacking](http://hetland.org/writing/instant-hacking.html),
  a goofy but decently good explanation of programming with examples in python
- [instant python](http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html),
  the alternative to instant hacking if you already know how to program
- do one of these tutorials, and try to get through it as fast as you can
  - [codecademy interactive tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python),
    this is a pretty easy and cleverly designed interface for learning the basics
  - [google's python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/?csw=1)
    this is a pretty straightforward and informative read, with plenty of code
    examples to bring you up to speed on python from a developer's perspective
- [resource for python tutorials](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers),
  there are lots of good tutorials here. choose two and read through them and do the exercises.
  I recommend [learn python in 10 minutes](https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/) and
  [python koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans/wiki)
- [packages and modules](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html),
  read to 6.4.1 inclusive

(recommended time spent)
if you've never programmed before, [4 hours]
if you've programmed before, [2 hours]
if you already know python and want a refresher [1 hour]

iterate
=======
learn software engineering, from the ground up
----------------------------------------------


Iterate is a repo of suggested workflows for guided self-teaching in
software engineering concepts. 
_suggested_ is the key word here,
since the whole point is to give a basic foundation for you teaching
yourself how to code. The goal of this project is to encourage you to
step outside of your comfort zone, to learn new things, to experiment, and
to break stuff!

###about this repo
Workflows that are grouped into the same category will be organized by
directory. Each directory will contain a readme prescribing their recommended order.
Python is the main programming language used here because it's easy to learn,
easy to work with, and the developer community surrounding it has created
a very mature codebase for future Python developers to work in.


###Where to start?
(again, this is all _recommended_. you do you!)


If you're just starting out, you might want to start with...

- the [programming workflow](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/iterate): basic tools and concepts that
you'll need as a programmer, such as how to use a shell and what git is for
- the [python workflow](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/iterate): a few resources for
giving yourself a jumpstart into the python language
- the [iterating workflow](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/iterate): when you get bored of reading the
other workflows, this one has some helpful tips on _how_ to learn programming,
how to get better faster, and how to debug things
- [flask/ workflow](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/iterate)



skim most of this. skip what you know, skip what bores you. learn what you need to achieve your goal.

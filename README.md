iterate
=======
learn software engineering, from the ground up
----------------------------------------------


Iterate is a repo of suggested workflows for guided self-teaching in
software engineering concepts. 
__suggested__ is the key word here,
since the whole point is to give a basic foundation for __you__ teaching
__yourself__ how to code. The goal of this project is to encourage you to
step outside of your comfort zone, to learn new things, to experiment, and
to break stuff!
It aims to break down whole areas of learning and give focus and direction
to your growth.

###about this repo
Workflows that are grouped into the same category will be organized by
directory and will contain a readme prescribing their recommended order.
Python is the main programming language used here because it's easy to learn,
easy to work with, and the developer community surrounding it has created
a very mature codebase for future Python developers to work in.


###Where to start?
(again, this is all __recommended__. you do you!)


- the [iterating workflow](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/iterate) has helpful tips on how to learn programming,
how to get better faster, and how to debug things
- the [programming workflow](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/iterate) talks about basic tools and concepts that
you'll need as a programmer, such as how to use a shell and what git is for
- the [python workflow](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/iterate) has a few resources for
giving yourself a jumpstart into the python language
- for web development see the [flask/ workflow](https://github.com/jazzyfresh/iterate)
